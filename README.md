[STTextView](https://github.com/krzyzanowskim/STTextView) typing completions with [TextFormation](https://github.com/ChimeHQ/TextFormation).

- ⚠️ There are currently some Swift concurrency-related incompatiblities that prevent this from building.
- ⚠️ There is a bug related to undo. I haven't tracked this down yet.

## Installation

Add the plugin package as a dependency of your application, then register/add it to the `STTextView` instance:

```swift
import TextFormation
import TextFormationPlugin

let filters = [
    StandardOpenPairFilter(open: "[", close: "]")
]

let providers = WhitespaceProviders(
    leadingWhitespace: WhitespaceProviders.passthroughProvider,
    trailingWhitespace: WhitespaceProviders.removeAllProvider
)

textView.addPlugin(
    TextFormationPlugin(filters: filters, whitespaceProviders: providers)
)
```

Note that both the `Filter` array and `WhitespaceProviders` must be specified statically and cannot be changed for the lifetime of the plugin. If you need to change these, when the document type changes for example, the plugin must be re-created.
